GOALS AND PHILOSOPHIES:
	1) Nerf gun damage to reduce constant one-shot kills (especially from pistols)
	2) Make Assault Rifles less overpowered, make non-Assault Rifles worth using
	3) Balance weapon accuracy around close-quarters combat
	4) Integrate changes from Liberal Additions
	5) Real weapon names
	6) More weapons

FUTURE PLANS
---

REBALANCE/OVERHAUL IDEAS THAT CANNOT BE DONE THROUGH XML?
	"Two-tier" Kidnap System
		Melee weapons protect you from kidnapping against other melee, but not guns
		Guns protect you from kidnapping against melee weapons AND guns
		
	Ammo Pools
		See: http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=171444.msg8016447#msg8016447
		
	"C" Gun Law and Beyond
		Civilians start carrying guns at "C" Gun Laws (Handguns) 
		Civilians carry a wider, heavily-armed variety of guns at "C+" Gun Laws (Rifles, machineguns, SMGs). It's the second amendment, after all.
		
	"Death's Door/Bleedout"
		Hitting 0 health incapacitates you. Hitting -50 health kills you.
		
	"Attack to wound/Attack to kill" combat style
		Toggle your attack styles to focus on wounding (Only limbs can be targeted) or killing (default combat style)
		
	Automatic Targeting Upgrade / Smart Targeting
		Targets that are "Badly Wounded" or "Near Death" are not valid targets IF healthier targets are still alive. 
		Your Liberals are much smarter in combat, and will not focus all their fire on a near-death target instead of a healthy target.
		
	"Manual Combat Targeting" toggle
		Toggle this option to manually control WHO your squadmates attack. Useful for focusing your fire on a tank before killing off the escorts.
		
	"X Sees the Squad's Liberal Weapons"
		Get rid of this fucking bullshit. It should merely INCREASE suspicion when in public, not INSTANTLY raise the alarm. Only have it raise the alarm in private areas (Ex. Military Base, Prison)
		
	Vice Squad Chase Sequence
		Getting caught by the Vice Squad while prostituting gives you the "On-foot escape sequence" for when you get caught selling brownies. The player has more control over what their Liberals should do if they get caught prostituting, rather than instant arrest.
		
	CCS Safehouses
		You can now take an alternative route, letting you sneak into the safehouse.
		The CCS boss CAN and WILL escape if you take too long to get to him when Conservatives are alerted.
		
	Automatic Reload Outside of Combat
		Liberals with empty weapons are capable of reloading outside of combat. Simply press the "Fight" key when nobody is in sight, and any Liberals with empty weapons will reload.
		
	Skill Progression
		"Fast" skill progression affects ALL skills. Driving, Seduction, Persuasion, etc. Not just a select few.
		
	Raids
		The Police Station is no longer able to launch Army raids against you now. Only the Army Base can do that.
			Shutting down the Police Station stops SWAT raids, but will NOT stop Army raids
			Shutting down the Army Base stops Army raids, but will NOT stop SWAT raids.
		
	Pawnshop
		Damaged Clothes can be sold, but for no money OR half money
		
	Assigned Ammo
		Option to assign ALL available ammo to a Liberal, rather than one at a time
		
	Firing Range
		The Firing Range can train weapon skills up to level FOUR, but no more. $120 a day to cover for ammo expenses.
		
---
/// OLD and ARCHIVED BELOW: IGNORE THIS
Reduced lethality of guns (Less one-shot kills)
	Burst-capable weapons (AA12/AK47/M4/M16/M249/MP5) have maximum random damage nerfed
	Non-burst weapons (38/44/45/9mm/AR15/deagle/shotgun) have maximum random damage nerfed
		AK47 stronger than 5.56-based weapons (AR15/M16/M4).
		.45 stronger than 9mm-based weapons (9mm/SMG)
		No difference between 5.56/7.62 and 9mm/45 damage in vanilla LCS
	Higher-caliber weapons (7.62/44/45/50) still out-damage lower-caliber (38/9mm/5.56) due to being nerfed less

Accuracy rebalance for close-quarters combat (Smaller guns more accurate, bigger guns less accurate in general)
	AK47: -5 accuracy penalty due to recoil of a 7.62 and weapon length
	M4: -2
	M16: -4 due to burst fire
	AR15: -3
	SMG: +3
	38, 9mm: +2
	44, 45: +1
	M249: -1
